# 👋 Hi, I’m Abdulmuhsen (aka @AHAKuo)  

I’m a **Game Developer, Storyteller, and Toolmaker** — building worlds, characters, and the systems that make games possible.  
I don’t just make games — I also make the **toolkits** that help others bring theirs to life. 

I founded [AHAKuo Creations](https://ahakuo.com/)

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks
I always build tools that make my life easier — and I release them so they can make yours easier too:  

- **Signalia Pro** — Complete Unity toolkit (UI, pooling, events, saving/loading, transitions).  
- **Structura** — Utilities, extensions & coding helpers.  
- **Amazing UI Navigation** — Effortless D-Pad / controller-friendly menu navigation.  
- **2D Layer Organizer** — Streamlined sorting & layer management.

## ✨ What I Do
- 🎨 Write stories and design lovable, larger-than-life characters.  
- 💻 Develop full games from scratch (code, art, design, audio).  
- ⚙️ Create Unity tools & frameworks that speed up development.  
- 🎙 Voice act (specializing in villainous/demonic tones and whimsical fairy voices).
